## System Implementation

We developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for surgical education 
using BioClinicalBERT embeddings and FAISS vector search. The system indexed 598 
medical text chunks from authoritative clinical guidelines, generating 768-dimensional 
embeddings optimized for the medical domain.

## Performance Metrics

The system demonstrated strong retrieval performance with a mean query latency of 
78 ms, successfully retrieving relevant content for 100% of 
test queries. Embedding quality analysis showed high consistency with mean inter-chunk 
similarity of 0.995 (σ = 0.004), indicating 
coherent semantic representation of medical content.
