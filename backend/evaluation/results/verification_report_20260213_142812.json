In the context provided, the evidence is described as having low or very low certainty, which affects decision-making (see Context: \"...the certainty in these effects was rated as low or very low owing to the risk of bias and imprecision of the estimates...\"). Conducting further research could increase the precision and quality of estimates, and potentially reduce the risk of bias by using more robust methodologies and larger sample sizes. This could lead to either the reinforcement of current recommendations or a reevaluation and change in direction if new data suggests different outcomes or effects. Therefore, additional research is likely to provide a clearer understanding and could shift current practices by either strengthening the existing guidelines or redirecting them based on improved evidence quality ([see Context](#context)).",

This involves careful dissection to clearly expose the cystic duct and cystic artery before any structures are clipped or cut. Another strategy involves the use of intraoperative cholangiography to help delineate the biliary anatomy more clearly during surgery, reducing the risk of inadvertently injuring the bile duct.\n\nFor more detailed information or specific studies, reviewing literature focused explicitly on cholecystitis management would be necessary.",
